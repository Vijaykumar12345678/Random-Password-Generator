# Random-Password-Generator
Installation
Open a terminal and run:

$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello


If this opens our sweet Streamlit Hello app in your browser, you're all set! If not, head over to our docs for specific installs.

The app features a bunch of examples of what you can do with Streamlit. Jump to the quickstart section to understand how that all works.



Quickstart
A little example
Create a new file streamlit_app.py with the following code:

import streamlit as st
x = st.slider("Select a value")
st.write(x, "squared is", x * x)
Now run it to open the app!

$ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
